## rballen.github.com (ver 0.1.0)
This is personal blog site for rballen. I've migrated/lost a lot of posts on my old wordpress site. This will prevent that from ever happening again. 

## Content

Most of the content will be stored in my gists with a few sentences describing some code if necessary.
